Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The weight tracking app was designed to help users looking to manage their weight. The app allows users to set a goal weight, track their weight daily with daily logs, and receieve a SMS message congratulating them, when they reach their goal. This app is designed for all people, whether they are looking to gain weight, lose it, or maintain it.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To meet the needs of the users, the app required three main screens a login screen, SMS notification permission screen, and the home screen. Within these screens are several features. Everything is made and designed for simplistic functionality. The app is meant to be easy to use, so the barrier of entry is lower for all people. The app was successful in its simplistic design, but the functionality still has a few kinks to be worked out.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
Originally, I struggled with managing my project and using strategies and best coding practices, but I learned quickly. After learning my lesson, I broke the project into pieces to make it more managable. I focused on one feature at a time. I also applied the best practices of coding like keeping my code modular and using consistent naming conventions. These strategies made development much more manageable and ensured debugging was done promptly, so no errors lingered. In the future, I can apply these same strategies to larger projects (hopefully in a job) to keep them organized and maintainable.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing was very important in this project. In my development, I was constantly testing, and I used the Android Emulator in Android Studio to do my testing. The importance of testing is shown in my lack of success. I tested my app and the login screen and home screen function great, but testing revealed my SMS permission screen wasn't working properly, but I did have it work once before. If I would have continually tested my project, while changing stuff, I could have been more successful with the creation of my app.


Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
While developing the app, I encountered numerous bugs, including some that completely prevented the app from building or launching on the emulator. In one of the instances, my computer froze to the point that I had to turn off my the power supply. In another instance, I had to roll back the project because I had no idea what the problem was. Having these errors after making so many changes was a major challenge because it made it difficult to debug and test. To overcome this, I began testing more frequently and checking the error logs before running my program. I also began breaking my code into smaller chunks and testing frequently so that I could pinpoint where the errors were occurring, making them infinitely easier to fix. By taking this step-by-step debugging approach, I was able to eliminate critical errors. 


In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I definitely found the most succes with the home screen component of the app. I think my home screen and its features were rather exceptional. The home screen displays the users current goal and weight log history, and has the features to allow the user to set their goal weight by tapping the goal weight in the top left corner of the screen, and make weight entries using the plus button in the bottom right corner of the screen.
